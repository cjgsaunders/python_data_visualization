# python_data_visualization

This ipynb visualises the reported health of survey respondents versus their education and income using Python Pandas, MatPlotLib and Seaborn. This was part of data exploration, preparing to build a model. The original dataset has over 100 categories, too many to feed directly to a machine learning algorithm.

The goal was to use the data from The Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html, create some research questions and answer them with machine learning.

I used this to build a classifier that predicts how health a person is based on social factors.
